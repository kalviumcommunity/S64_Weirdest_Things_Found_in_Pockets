# Weirdest Things Found in Pockets

**Project Overview:** This project is a fun and interactive web application where users can log and view bizarre items they’ve discovered in their own or others’ pockets. The app allows users to submit their findings, rate the "weirdness level" of each item, and browse a dynamically updated list. The goal is to create an engaging and humorous platform for sharing quirky experiences while learning how to build a full-stack application.

# Key Features:

- User Submission Form: Users can add a new item and assign a weirdness level (1-10).
- Dynamic Item List: A display of all submitted items, sorted by weirdness level.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the application is accessible and visually appealing across devices.
- Real-Time Updates: Items added by users appear instantly without a page refresh.
- User Authentication (Future Feature): Allow users to log in and manage their submissions.
- Search and Filter (Future Feature): Users can search for specific items or filter by weirdness level.

# Tech Stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (to store user submissions and their weirdness ratings)

**Other Tools:**
 - Git for version control
 - Postman for API testing
 - VS Code as the development environment

# Why This Project: 

This project stands out for its quirky and lighthearted premise, making it enjoyable to build and interact with. It provides an excellent opportunity to:

- Develop full-stack development skills by combining a robust backend with an interactive frontend.
- Practice creating RESTful APIs and handling data persistence using MongoDB.
- Improve JavaScript skills, especially in DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Gain experience in responsive design for better user accessibility.
- Explore future scalability options like user authentication and advanced filtering.

By working on this project, I will not only strengthen my technical skills but also create a fun product that demonstrates creativity and practical application of web development concepts.
